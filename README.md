# Fork test
This repository is fork test. I will fork it from another account. If the original repository is deleted, what happens to the forked repository? This is verification.

## Verification result
Yay! The forked repository was not deleted even if the original repository was deleted. Of course, the link that traces to the original repository was deleted.
